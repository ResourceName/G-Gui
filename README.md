# G-Gui
The admin system that just does it.


# What is it?
G-Gui is an admin system for the game Roblox that allows easy access to commands and moderation, and fun things.
It was designed because HD Admin was outdated, Adonis was laggy and rarely updated, and Kohls [infinite] didn't have very good GUI.

# Huh? Why aren't there releaseS?
I can't upload my MainModule to GitHub until I get my new computer.
For now, 
Here's the loader: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/140726902702135/GGui-Admin
And here's the MainModule: https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/97846481879289/GGui-MainModule

# How frequent are updates?
Monthly.
